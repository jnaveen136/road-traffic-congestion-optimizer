# Road Traffic Congestion Optimizer

This project simulates a traffic network and uses machine learning to predict congestion on roads. It combines predicted congestion levels with Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the fastest route.

## Features
- Synthetic traffic data generation
- Random forest model to predict congestion factor
- Weighted graph using NetworkX
- Dijkstra algorithm to compute optimal path

## Run Instructions
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn networkx
python app.py
```

## Output
- Best route from A to C
- Estimated travel time considering congestion
